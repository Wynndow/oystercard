Oyster Card Challenge
====================

This is a solution to Makers Academy's [Oystercard Challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/oystercard).

This solution uses a test-driven approach, with unit and feature tests implemented using [RSpec](http://rspec.info).

## Installation

Need to clone the repository and then change into the directory:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Andrew47/Oyster_card.git
$ cd Oyster_card
```
Will need to run `bundle`. This will install any required files.

## Usage

To use the program, run pry and load the oystercard.rb file:

```
$ pry
$ require './lib/oystercard'
```
Then a new Oyster Card can be created (`oystercard = Oystercard.new`) and a new
station (`station = Station.new('name',1)`). The first argument is the station's
name. The second argument is the station's zone.

###The Customer can

* View their card's balance: `oystercard.balance`
* Add money (e.g. £1): `oystercard.top_up(1)`
* Journey between stations:

```
entry_station = Station.new('entry', 1)
exit_station = Station.new('exit', 2)
oystercard.touch_in(entry_station)
oystercard.touch_out(exit_station)
```
* See list of previous trips: `oystercard.journey_history`
* See zone of station: `station.zone`

The customer cannot have a balance above £90 on their card. The fare is calculated
dependent on the zones of the entry and exit stations. This is deducted from the
Oyster Card balance. Fines are charged when touching in or out is missed.
